The sector of a country's economy that isn't run by its government.
PRIVATE SECTOR
That's the word!
Cuban Economy
AZUZ: Running a business in the private sector means risks and rewards.
You can set your own prices, but there's no one to really fall back on if things don't go so well.
Shasta Darlington looks at what's in store for thousands of Cubans who are about to lose their government jobs and make the shift into the private sector.

SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, HAVANA: A tall order in communist Cuba: finding jobs for half a million laid-off workers in the private sector.
Here in Old Havana, not everyone is celebrating this capitalist notion.
Like it or not, employees at this barbershop around the corner are being pushed off the state payroll and handed the shop.
They'll be able to set prices and keep earnings, but they'll now have to pay taxes and rent, and there's no longer the guarantee of a fixed income.
GERARDO, HAVANA BARBER [TRANSLATED]: "I've been working for the state for years now and I'm not interested in going private," says Gerardo.
"I want to keep working for the state."
DARLINGTON: Cuba plans to shed ten percent of public sector jobs over the next six months and allow more private enterprise to absorb the unemployed.
A dramatic attempt by President Raul Castro to reshape the sputtering economy.
He says the state simply can't afford a bloated and unproductive workforce.
But don't expect American-style big business.
Cuba's new entrepreneurs will be encouraged to start small operations, maybe driving taxis, laying bricks or perhaps repairing toys.
Now, to get an idea of what's in store for them, we're talking to some of the people already working in the country's miniscule private sector.
Emilio Mendoza was laid off during Cuba's last major economic crisis in the '90s.
He bought a government license and set up a cobbler's shop in his driveway.
He says Cubans should see this as an opportunity.
Isidro, a taxi driver, says it depends on how much the state charges its new entrepreneurs in taxes and licensing fees.
They all agree, the days of getting paid by the government, whether you work or lounge about, are over.
Still, the state controls about 90 percent of the economy.
These modest proposals aren't likely to radically shift that balance, but they will give life to a new class of small businesses that could change the face of Cuba.
